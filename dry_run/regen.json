        "output": "Incorrect greetings: \n1. \"Hey there!\" - This greeting is overly casual and doesn't fit the tone of the conversation.\n2. \"What's the haps?\" - This phrase is much too colloquial and informal.\n3. \"Good evening!\" - This greeting isn't suitable considering it's morning.\n4. \"What's going on?\" - This phrase is not an appropriate greeting as it doesn't acknowledge the other person.  It is too informal and lacks politeness.  It also assumes the other person has something to say.  As a greeting, it is too terse.  A better greeting would be \"Hello, how are you?\" or something similar.  A friendly, polite greeting that acknowledges the other person is more appropriate for this interaction.  Additionally, if a more casual greeting is suitable for the situation then a phrase or statement such as \"Good morning, how are you doing today?\" would be a more appropriate choice.  The phrase \"Good morning\" acknowledges both the time of day as well as the other person.  Furthermore, phrases such as \"What's up?\" or \"How's it going?\" are too informal for polite conversations.  Therefore, the greeting \"Good morning! How are you doing?\" is appropriate for this interaction.  It is friendly, polite, and acknowledges the other person.  As such, the other greetings listed are incorrect.  The correct greeting should be \"Good morning! How are you doing?\".  This is an appropriate greeting as it is friendly, polite, and acknowledges the other person.

Both countries engaged in a bitter ideological struggle and several proxy wars, both economic and military. The Cold War had a profound influence on international politics and the course of the 20th century, and it was ultimately ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the two superpowers deployed massive resources to compete with each other, with the United States and its allies supporting democratic regimes in an effort to contain the spread of Communism. The Cold War ultimately altered the global balance of power and had long-lasting implications in the geopolitical landscape.",
